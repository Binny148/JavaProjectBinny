(Loops)


(*)Programming concept which allwos us to execute certain set of block of code/statements within the given condition .

(*) syntax
for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
	System.out.println("Happy new year")------> will print 5 times

}

int i = 0;----> initialization: happens only once in the beginning 
i<5;  ---> termination condtion: when this result is false, the loop will end
i++----> update :increase or decrease a value
keyword---->iteration: one exection of the code inside the loop 
what can we put inside of a loop -----( anything )

Each part of the loop is optional 

-Inginite loops:

>concept when the loop does not have a stopping point or when the termination condition is never met 

for( ; ;){
	
}

for(int i=0; i > -1;){
	// statement 
}

(*) Note: how many times to iternate through a String
----> length times
(*) Note: How to get each character:

charAt(index)

========================================================================
-Break; this is keyword used within the loop to stop the loop
