1. PRIMITIVE DATA IN JAVA 

Byte
short
int---------> we more focus on int 
long
float
double
char----->Ex , . ! % h 2 5 , put it in ' '
boolean---> true or false 
String===> Not in Primitives , because it starts with Capital letters .

2. TYPE CASTING
If you are transfering from smaller container to bigger container , you can smilpy assign right away
Ex: int age = 24;

long  age2= age;

* Complation error : when your code won't compile successfully IntelliJ willndetect and tell you .

* If you are transferring from bigger container to smaller contariner , you must Explicitly cast it .


EX;  int age = 25;

short s = age;====>



3. ARTHEMTIC OPEARTORS 

-,+,/,*,%

Ex:10/3 = 3
10%3=1;
Remainder/modulus


4.PRINT STATEMENT 

System.out.print();
System.out.println();



5. CONCATINATION

adding , combine 
String name = "James";
System.out.println("Hey! My name is " _ name );

6. STRING -----> object datatype that can store bunch of letters or number or any other character 

7. ASSIGNMENT , DECLARTION

Statement :  one line of code that ends with semi colon

--------------------------------

Shorthand assignment opeartions

------------------------------


when you want to increment or decrement the values of numbers by certain amount you can always use shorthand  assignement opeartions.


EX: 

int age = 25 

age = age +11;

age += 11;
