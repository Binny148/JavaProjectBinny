Nov 16,2019 class and object 

Java allows us to creat objects in computer using classes.

class---> type or blueprint for an object 

Datatypes in Java

1. Primitive 
--> EX: int i = 6;
->primitive datatype are able to s store only one pecie of info.
2.Object 

--> object datatype are able to store many pieces of infmroartion .
--> object types are able to store not only pieces of infmroation , but they can store behviores of objects.

We can creat objects using classes 

1. We have to creat a class and set the rules for it .
2. Creat an object from it .


String name = "James";

* Class has two things

1. Data fields, attributes , instance varibales , properties 
2. Behaviors , methods .

EX: 
public class dog{
	
	String name;
	int age;
	String color;
	double weight;
	String breed;

	public void bark(){

	System.out.println("Dog is barking ");

    } 
}

Class vs Object 

* Clas is a type that specifies the instance variables and behaviors. We can say that class is a template or blueprint 

* Object:an actual object that got created by the class . Multiple objects can be created by one class.

Creating an object:

- We use 'new ' Keyword everthime we creat an object .
-instantiate ---> creat an object 
- object or instance 


*** By default when we have local variable same as instance variable , it uses local variable within the method .

=========================================================
Constructor
==========================================================

--> Special method that is used to creat an object.
==> It is NOT a method
==> It must have same name as class.
==> what does it do ?
--> It creates an object 
==> Do we have to creat a constructor ?
No. If you don't creat one , then Java creates one for you .
==> Every single class have a constructor 
--> you don't see one if you don't creat one.
--> Because default constructor is hidden , but it's there .

--> What kind of code is written inside the constructor?

* To set intial state of object 

If programmer doesn't creat one constructor then Java creates constructor by itself. This constructor is called DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR . Default constructor is hidden and it does not take any argument . ( No parameters).

* However, we can creat a constructor that takes some argument. And we can use those arguments(parameters) to set intial values for a newly created object.

* If you create one constructor yourself, NO MORE defualt constructor is provided by Java .
